# WTF is this ?
This is my resume. Since this is LaTeX code, I guess I can share it with fellow LaTeX lovers, and eventually use this repository as a vector of distribution.

# But can I use the code ?
Of course, you can. But you'd better change my infos, which are located in
the src/cvfrench.tex. For licenses nazis, let's say the code in src/include.tex
is published under the WTFPL public license.
